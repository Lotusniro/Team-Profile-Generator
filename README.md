# Team-Profile-Generator
Create a html file of the team using inquirer,filesystem and node.

## Description
This application is a team profile generator that uses inquirer to prompt the user for information about the team manager, engineer, and intern. The user can input any number of team members, and  generate an team.html file that displays a nicely formatted team  based on the information provided by the user.
The classes are created using the constructor function and the classes are extended to create the subclasses.
Employee is the parent class with Manager, Engineer, and Intern as subclasses.
There are three main modules in this application.
jest, inquirer, and fs.
jest is installed to test the unit tests for the classes.
inquirere is used to prompt the user for the information.
fs is used to write the file of the team.html.
